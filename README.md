	What is iHeart?
</h2>
<p>iHeart is inspired by people's experience of shopping online. </p>
<p>If you are shopping on certain website (like ETSY.com), and find several amazing items, but you cannot decide which one to buy, what will you do? You would probably <b>marked them as "favorite"</b>, compare them and make the decision later.</p>
<p>But what if you are browsing several websites? Of course, you may put those links in your bookmarks. But could you remember what the link is after several weeks? Even though you may have renamed the link like "BROWN FLATS FROM STEVE MADDEN", wemen know "COGNAC FLATS" and "NATURAL BALLERINAS" could be totally different. Nothing could be more straight-forward than pictures, especially when shopping.</p>
<p>iHeart is a simple extension for Chrome in order to solve such kind of situations.</p>
